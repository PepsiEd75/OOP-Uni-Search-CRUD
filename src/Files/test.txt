Hey guys just wanted to let you that the application is working perfectly fine but there is one big problem, 
when I wanted to check any universities in South Korea. The website does not respond at all. Maybe this is 
due to the fact that there is no parameter for South Korea in the API. Therefore, I suggest you should at 
least state an alert so that the user will not wait, expecting the website to output the info.
